ECMAScript 6: Exploit The Future
================================

Proposed way back in 2011, the new JavaScript standard
is going to change dramatically the way we write code.

ES6 will be officially released next summer, so today
is the right time to dive into new syntax and features,
to look how they work and to start exploiting the future!

During this talk you'll learn about things that are ready
to use with minimum effort: Promises, Symbols, Iterators,
Maps, Sets and handful of new Object/String/Array/Math goodies.

Besides that we'll explore arrow functions, generators,
proxies, classes and other syntax that brings even more
power to your code and makes it cleaner.
